\description{
The `mtcars_df` dataset provides information extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.
It comprises data on fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance
for 32 cars (1973â€“74 models). The dataset name has been suffixed with `_df` to identify
it as a data frame, making it easier to distinguish within the `sampledatasets` package.
